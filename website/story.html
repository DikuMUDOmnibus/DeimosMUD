    <h1>The History of Deimos</h1>
    <h2>
      As compiled and recorded by the Master Scribe of Phobos, Thomas Tillquin
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>
        At first everything existed in harmony and everything was good...
      </i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      And all was good until Cest, the god of power and war, became bored with it
      all and laid waste over all creation. His wrath destroyed everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the high goddess Phobe began to weep over the loss of
      order and the bringing of chaos. Cest also did cry over all the
      destruction he had brought forth upon the universe. From Phobe's tears
      sprung forth, land, sea, air, and space. And Cest's tears became
      Calim, the god of life. Calim was tall and strong and also very cunning
      and mischievous. Calim created a giant potter's wheel, and from it he
      molded all creatures that live in the universe and all that will come to
      live. But his greatest creation, which he worked on for seven whole years,
      was man. They were intelligent and had domination over all creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were great and from them were birthed heroes and legends. These legends
      and heroes slowly divided men into two factions: the Titans and the
      Calimishans. The Titans worshipped Cest and the Calimishans worshiped
      Calim, but Phobe had no worshippers and slowly faded into a small spirit.
      The Titans were monstrous people who lived in the city of Ivten. The
      Calimishans were very mischievous and intelligent and lived in the desert
      as nomads.
    </p>
    <h3>...</h3>
    <p>
      Ages came and went, and the long Demon-Titan wars were fought and ended and the
      Titans grew back into a powerful race again...
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cest grew angry because the Demons began to worship Calim to spite Cest and his Titans...
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Cest's anger towards Calim led them to send their worshippers to battle.
      But as the Calimishans and Demons stood on the threshold of the city of
      Ivten, the great Titans began to fight among each other. The legends and
      heroes of the Titans were all either poisoned or killed until all that
      remained were two Titans. One rushed to Calim's people to beg for their
      help, but they slew him without hearing his plea. The last seemed to have
      disappeared, and over the ages Cest slowly took the thought of Ivten out of
      people's minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cest did not forget the blood of the Titan who was slain needlessly.
      In his madness, Cest cursed all the Calimishans who had shed the blood of a
      Titan. From the high mountains, he commanded: "All who shed the
      blood of my kindred will be condemned to the worst fate possible: You will
      have no god for all eternity." Thus, the Calimishans exiled the cursed among
      them, and the exiles left the city, traveling south many leagues to rid
      themselves of the persecution of the Calimishans and Cest. They came upon
      an outcrop that was well protected by steep precipices in all directions, and their leader,
      Perneus, told the exiles to build a city on that ground and declared that it would be a
      grand city. The Oracle of the exiles blessed the ground of the city and
      said that, many years later, the god who was forgotten would take pity on
      the exiles.
    </p>
    <h3>...</h3>
    <p>
      Many, many long years passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city of Exile, as it was called among all who lived there, grew and
      prospered, and Calim looked upon them favorably, but Cest reminded him of
      the decree he had made thousands of years ago and Calim was forced to
      yield. Then Phobe, the high goddess, began to gain followers in the
      city of the Exiles. She did not heed Calim because he had no dominion or
      creed over her. Under her rule and worship the city of Exile became a
      great city, and heroes and legends began to flock to the city and convert
      their faith to Phobe. Phobe was pleased by her new race of people and
      decreed their city be called Phobos after her. The Exiles agreed and began
      to call themselves Phobians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Calimishans began to grow jealous of the Phobians' glory and their high
      goddess. So the Calimishans allied with the Demons and their new god, Deimos,
      the god of destruction and evil. Driven to insanity by their greed, they
      desired to ravage Phobos and reduce it to ruins. Deimos was evil at
      heart and spread his word to all and drove them all to an insane rage
      against Phobos. The hosts of Calim and Deimos sat on the Stalwart Plains
      gathering for battle. But Phobe had warned the Phobians of their fate and
      they were ready. Thus, the Phobians held off wave after wave of Demons and
      Calimishans from their fortified acropolis, earning it the nickname 'City of Eternity'. Deimos
      grew angry and decided to take his anger out on the Calimishans. So the Demons
      started to eat the Calimishans until but a hundred were left. Calim saved them
      by bringing one of his unused clay Titans to life. The Titan fought off
      the Demons and drove them back to the hells from which they came. The
      sight of the Titan gave hope to Cest, but sadly the Titan was mortally
      wounded in the battle. So Cest spirited him away to the moon above
      the world. Because of this, the moon now glows
      constantly in the sky from the blood of the Titan. The Calims retreated to
      their city, realizing their folly; and Phobe, being benevolent, only sent
      minor plagues upon them and cursed their luck for five thousand
      years.
    </p>
    <h3>...</h3>
    <p>
      Yet Deimos's dark influence has continued to cover the land. No man alive today remembers
      a time before the evil and hatred he has sown. Even the names our ancestors gave to this world
      have been forgotten; the only world we know is the world under the shadow of Deimos, and the only
      name we have for it is his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is hope, as Phobe has set it upon her citizens to rid the world of Deimos's evil.
      In her city, four guilds have been established by the four greatest Heroes of our time: the
      Cleric, the Warrior, the Mage, and the Thief. Adventurers come from far and wide to train with
      these masters and prepare for battle with the forces of Deimos. The Age of Heroes has begun.

    <h2 style='margin-top: 5em;'>Notes:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A reference to the Demon-Titan wars can be found in Book 4, Chapter 5 of Phobos's
        history; the definitive chronicle is believed to have been lost in the
        ruins of Ivten.
      </li>
      <li>
        The moon of Deimos is now called Cesta after the god Cest, and there are rumors
        of a travel device that Cest used that might be able to bring mortals there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since the writing of this text, the city of Calimishan has been closed to outsiders
        and most of the tribe has taken to roaming the desert.
