boots zan'lir~
&DBoots of the &RZan'Lir&n~
A pair of black skinned boot glisten sickly.~
The boots, which can be made only by the work of Siss'rith craftsmanship
and arcane arts, come from the terrible Zan'lir, the beast which burrows
under the subterranean Zan'lir Jungle.  It is said that the boots are very
rare, but are instilled with great power given by the magic from the
Siss'rith battlemages.

A string of beads that stink of death lie here turning the ground crimson.~

fountain stone~
&CA Bubbling Fountain&n~
&BAn fountain of odd stone is &Cbubbling&B merrily here.&n~
The fountain is a bit worn, showing it has been used in the village
for quite sometime.  Perhaps it was a gift from their God, or a feat
of the peoples own enginuity.  Whatever the case, the fountain seems to
have an endless supply of pure clean water.

bookshelf shelf siss'rith~
&yA tattered shelf&n~
&yA tattered shelf is standing against a wall, it looks to hold a few books.&n~
Within the shelf there are two books.  One that says "Of the Siss'rith
and Zan'lir".  The other looks to be a journal of the commander.  So
a diary and a history book?  Perhaps some interesting reading.

DAY120~
A man came to us recently.  Not one from the trees, although he said
that he had visited those humands as well.  This man was named Marushin,
and said he came from "outside".  Perhaps he is another god, although
he claimed not to be.  He said out world is one within another, larger
world.  He gave me a book, that shows what happened between us and our
human enemies.  It begins to come clearer that the humans are not our
enemy, and if there is a larger world outside our own, which I still
doubt, then our fighting is meaningless.  Of course this could be a trick
from the humans to stop our attacks, which have been all but futile against
their defenses.  We have stopped our work with Zan'lir and it attacked
us. We drove the beast back, but cannot hope to destroy it either.  There
is much to ponder about over the recent events.  I hope I can lead my
people to their rightful destiny, and not one of damnantion.

DAY37~
The camp is now set after much work, and the destruction of some of the
jungle.  I did not wish to take such hast action, but we needed to be
settled with a defensive position incase the humans decided to attack.
I doubt they would as they seem well enough holed up in their trees, but
you can never be sure with them, they are quite cunning.  Zan'lir asked
for my presence recently, and I went to it.  It tried to pry into my
mind yet I resist.  This seemed to upset the creature, and he cast me
out of his cavern.  My men have not been feeling as strong, but morale
is still strong, as we seem to be more in control of ourselves than we
have been in many years.  I do not doubt the power Zan'lir but I am
beginning to doubt his motives.  It feels he is using us more to get
to Ranfir, than to give us dominion over the humans...

Perhaps my doubt it unjustified.  We lived with them in peace long enough
and now it is time to show them who the true rulers of our world is.

DAY1~
I Frysthak, after leading a revolt againt our corrupted leader, am now
taking control of our forces.  Its odd, this leader seemed to last the
shortest amount of time, compared to our last leaders, before being completly
consumed by the Zan'lir.  I must try my strongest to resist the forces
with which the Zan'lir works against us, while still using its power
as much as is possible.  I will not turn out like our last leader and
become one who feeds off the blood of our own kind.  The war camp must
be lain down again, in what I hope to be a permenant location.  Hopefully
we shall soon be settled and can look again to dominion over the humans.

book history~
This is a condensed account of the recent history of the Siss'rith, and
the Zan'lir.  It is said about 300 years ago the Siss'rith and the humans
of the jungle lived in harmony.  They lived under the guidance of the
God known as Ranfir.  There was commerce between the races, and prosperity
for both.  Life within the mountain was seemingly perfect.  Yet there
came one from under the earth known as Zan'lir.  It whispered lies to
the Siss'rith and ensnared them with promises of power and dominion over
the humans.  To show its power, it gave skin from one of its spawn to
the Siss'rith to make boots of power with.  With this gift, the Siss'rith
could no longer deny the dark whisperings inside them, and began to lay
seige to the human encampment.  Ranfir, fearing for its people, lifted
them to the skys and gave them new abode amongst the higest trees within
the jungle.  The Siss'rith continue to lay seige to the humans, but
the humans hope that one day they can co-exist with the Siss'rith, if
only the Zan'lir and all its kind could be removed from the world, perhaps
then things would return to as they were.

&DA Large Stone Key&n~
A large heavy key made of stone is lying on the earth.~
This is the key for the gates of the human village.  Much like the gates
this key looks almost indestructible.  It would be wise to keep this
safe.
