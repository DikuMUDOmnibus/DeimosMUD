portal gate archway~
Archway of the Gods!~
An archway created by the gods to provide their loyal worshipers access to other reals lies here.~

     A great wave of evil passes over you as you look more closely at the 
markings.  By the gods this is wrong.  You are sure that examining this
archway should have filled you with peace.  Could those subtle changes 
in the runes have caused such a major change in their meaning.

scroll auburn~
an Auburn Scroll~
An Auburn Scroll Sizzles with scribed energy.~
This scroll of Auburn parchment has a glow that seems to come from
the lettering written upon it.  As you look to see what it says
you are baffled.  It seems to have been written in a language 
you have never seen before.
