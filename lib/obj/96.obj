red loincloth cloth~
a red loincloth~
A flowing red piece of cloth lays on the ground.~
This is the red loincloth of Ares, the god of war.  His strength and powers have, well, rubbed
off onto this cloth.  Since Ares is no human, it's perfectly fine to use this loincloth for your
own protection.

the Mighty Sceptre of Kings~
A glowing sceptre lays on the ground here, pulsating with power.~
The mighty sceptre of Kings is a creation of Zeus himself.  Contemplating who he
should give it to, he naturally chose, Zeus!  The greatest and mightiest of all
Kings.

key dirt~
a dirt key~
A small dirt key has been taken from its can.~
This key is made of... dirt!  How dirt can be made to stay rigid enough, certainly
to operate a lock that's worth anything, is a mystery.

481 cannon grapeshot~
a 481 pound grapeshot cannon~
A 481 pound grapeshot cannon rests here, sinking into the floor.~
Bloody, bloody murder is what this weapon does.  Hundreds of steel balls the size
of large grapes blast toward the enemy from the muzzle of this cannon, hence the
name, grapeshot.  It weighs 481 pounds fully loaded and 200 pounds empty.  The
thought of 281 pounds of grapeshot splattering your ememies is gruesome indeed.

steel ballista~
a steel ballista~
A steel ballista as long as a baby whale lays here.~
Ballista's are huge crossbows, used to launch razor sharp harpoons at very
large targets.  Got a dragon or ogre that needs to be slain?  This is your
weapon.  One shot and the battle is over.

vault key~
the golden vault door key~
A beautifully carved golden key rests on the ground here.~
Few keys match the beauty of this one.  It must have a special purpose indeed,
considering the great attention given to carving symbols and other decorations 
on its handle.
