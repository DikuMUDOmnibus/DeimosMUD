&gAn &CE&Ya&Cs&Yt&Ce&Yr &CE&Yg&Cg&g is hiding in the grass here!~
   Every spring the Easter Bunny, Oryctolagus pascha, awakes from its
year-round hibernation to roam the world and deposit its hard-shelled eggs in
clumps of tall grass.  The Easter Bunny is unique in that it is the only
egg-laying mammal that is not a monotreme, distinguishing it from the platypus
and the echidna.  Furthermore, its eggs display some of the most vivid and
intricate color patterns--each one distinct from another--to be found in the
animal kingdom.

toilet titanium~
a Titanium Toilet~
A shiny Titanium Toilet stands on the floor dead-center.~
   Who knows why this toilet needs to be cast from a single solid block of
titanium?  Maybe it's a toilet spaceship that needs to withstand the high
temperatures of atmospheric reentry.
