&rDeimos &DHandbook - &WType: Exa Handbook&n~
&RThe Deimos &Whandbook&R is lying here, wanting you to read it!&n~

The Deimos handbook is a wonderfully crafted piece of work.  The leather has been beautifully
decorated, and it has been faded with age.  There is a plaque that is made of tarnished brass,
which reads: "Look Introduction".  The book holds all the knowledge someone new to Deimos
would wish to learn.

For those new to Deimos, they should know the mud is a multi-themed game.  That means, although
there is a consistent story-line for those wish to role-play, there is also no defining theme
to our zone layouts for 80% of Mud's zones.  They range from places like the Monopoly Board,
to the land of Oz!  Also another thing we are proud of is the newbie friendly atmosphere we
host.  As a new player you will notice you do not have much eq, if any at all.  Don
You really don't need to use equipment until probably level 10 or higher, as the lower level
mobs are pretty easy.  By that time you can start going out after your own equipment, or have
others try to find some for you.  Also try exploring the mud once you hit level 15 or so.
But be sure to ask before you enter areas, as some are not friendly places to be.  After all
exploring is half the fun, but you can't do it while dead!  And the main point of Deimos is
to bring enjoyment to our players.
