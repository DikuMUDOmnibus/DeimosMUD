breastplate plate adamantium~
&YA Shining Breastplate shod of the finest Adamantium&n~
The breastplate of the Grand Wizard Katwoman~
   This is clearly a breastplate that was mage specifically for a magical user
to wear; It only has protective metal on the front, and the back is made of a
strong leather, it also has large clippings at the top which allow for a
flowing cape or cloak to be adorned upon it, thus shielding people from it's
utter brillance.  The front is made of admantium which is forged to the highest
degree of strength and then it was enchanted with spells of great power.  The
metal also seems as new as the day it was forged, bearing no indentations are
markings.  In the upper left breast on the inside the words "For Ironman" are
inscribed on the adamantium with a firey magical script.
