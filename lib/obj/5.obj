Staff Wrath~
&RThe Staff of Wrath&n~
The &RStaff of Wrath&n floats here, as though someone left without it, but it didn't notice.~
   The Staff of Wrath is the great staff used by the demon Kalwrathi.  It has
the power to fufill someone's most vegenful thoughts but it also has the power
to fufill their thoughts of reconcilliation, in short when held in the hands of
an evil person it too becomes evil, spouting horns and bleeding from open sores
in the wood, but when held in the hands of a good person, it becomes a piece of
beautiful white and smooth wood that radiates brilliance and happiness.
