The Holy Painting~
&Wthe &BHoly &WPainting&n~
The Holy Painting of Arenburg's St. Jade is on hanging on the wall here.~
The painting shows the beautiful St.  Jade.  The painting was painted countless
years ago when Arenburg was first built.  The painting still looks in prime
condition and the frame consists of the highest quality pure gold.

Arenburg's Master Key~
A very large and complicated-looking key is lying here.~
The key is pretty large for a key and it has a ton of little notches and such
at the end.
