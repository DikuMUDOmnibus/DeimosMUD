amulet ranfir~
Amulet of Ranfir~
An amulet depicting two snakes eating each other by the tails, is laying here.~

The amulet of Ranfir is the sister to Zan'lirs amulet.  It was created by Ranfir, and given
to his shaman to show his love for his people.  It is said to protect the tribe from intruders,
and in times of great need, will summon Ranfir forth.  The emblem on the amulet is of the
two snakes, symbolizing Order and Chaos, eating each other from the tails and creating the
symbol for infinity in the process.  It shows that Ranfir is the God that balances Chaos and
Order, and while there is constant struggle between the two, Ranfir will watch over to make
sure neither has too much sway.

amulet ranfir~
the Amulet of Zan'lir~
An amulet depicting a large worm-like creature is lying here.~
The amulet has an image of the creature Zan'lir on it, and some words in an unknown language.
It is the amulet which was carried by the prophet for many years, after the founding of the
religion towards Zan'lir in Rulek.  It is said this amulet was created in likeness to another
which depicted the God Rulek/Ranfir. That amulet was lost when those who left Rulek went
into the wilderness.  This amulet is said to have been given to the high priest by the
Heirophant Maz.
