book speech~
   This is the Speech Help Book.  Here you will learn how to communicate with
your friends on Deimos MUD.  First of all, there are three types of speech:
MUD, Direct, and Normal.  MUD communication is the type of communication that,
when said, will be heard by everyone on the MUD at that time.  Perhaps you may
have heard some talk going on during our lessons such as: [someone] gossips,
'Hey people!  '.  These are actual people using MUD communication.  There are
five different MUD communications: Shout, Holler, Gossip, Grats, and Auction.
The first 4 do the same thing: Proclaim what you are saying across the MUD.  
Only Holler is not blockable and Shout has a limited range.  Auction is a bit
different, not only does it proclaim what you're saying across the MUD, but it
is an invitation to au For example, if you had a good piece of eq (equipment)
but you then found a better one, you could enter Auction Really good eq:
starting at 500g.  Then other people would auction their amount of money until
the final bidder was reached (you decide).  Go ah I'm in training for MUD!  
And see what happens.  If you wish not to hear these, simply enter No infront
of the word.  Such as typing: Nogossip will turn your ability to hear Gossip
off.  The next category is Direct Communication.  This is where you directly t
There are three different types of Direct Communication: Ask, Tell, and
Whisper.  They are all basically the same except that when you are Asked or
Telled by another person, you can simply enter Reply [whatever] to reply to
that person.  Whisper is only av Finally, there is Normal Communication.  
There are two types: Say and Mail.  Say is what usually everyone uses to talk.
Simply type Say and whatever you want to say and it will say it to anyone in
the room that you are in.  Mail is not exactly commmunicaio First you must find
the Post Office.  There you can do three things: Mail, k, and Receive.  Only
while at the Post Office can you do these actions.  If you wish to mail someone
something, enter Mail [Person's name] and commence writing the letter.  
Receive will get the mail in the form of an item.

   Some Items are containers and can hold other Items which takes off the
amount of Items in your Inventory that limits the amount of Items you can have
at a time.  Containers have caps that must be opened to be used but can also To
open them, simply enter Open and the name of the container.  Closing would use
Close.  To get an item out of a container, type Get, then the Item name, then
the container name.  Ex: Get stick bag.  To Put something in a container, enter
Put then the object name, then the container.  For each command, the cap must
be open.  There is another type of Item called a Scroll.  These Scrolls have
magical properties and will do different things when you enter Recite and the
scroll name and sometimes the object you want it to affect after that.  For
example, the Scroll of Identify will show all stats of an Item (say, a stick)
when recited on it.  To do this: you would type: Recite identify stick.  This
will then show the stats of the stick because you recited the scroll on it.  
Other Scrolls include the Scroll of Recall and the Scroll Written on Blue
Paper.  Potions are much like Scrolls in that they have magical properties.  
The difference is that they are Quaffed and they will only affect the user.  
For example, a Health Potion will recover your HP (Hit Points).  To make it do
this, you would enter: Quaff Potion and it would then be cast on you and your
HP would have recovered.  There is one more type of Item that you should know
about: That is Food and Water.  Without these, You will not be able to
regenerate your stats.  If you wish to eat, simply enter Eat and the food's
name.  To drink, type Drink and the liquid container's name.  Beware, though,
water containers can run out of liquid and must be refilled either by spell, or
by the fountain in Phobos.  To refill a container, type Fill and the
container's name, then the name of the liquid producer, such as a fountain.  
If you are unsure about what the content of a piece of food or water is, you
can Taste or Sip each one to make sure it seems okay.

ItemsPage1~
   This is the Item Help Book.  This will teach you the basics of operating and
manipulating Items.  Items are one of the most important factors of this game.
They determine how well you do in battle, how much stats you gain when you
level, etc.  The first thing about Items you should know is how to pick them
up.  If you wish to do so, simply enter Get and the Object's name.  For
example, if there is a stick on the ground, you would type: Get stick and you
will pick it up.  Once you have it, you can view the Item you picked up in your
Inventory by typing inventory.  If you don't want it anymore, just type Drop
and the Item's name while it's in your inventory.  You can observe it even
closer by typing Look and the name of the Item.  This might give you some
additional info on it.  If the item looks like it is wearable, it is called
Equipment or EQ for short.  If you wish to wear it, type wear and then the eq's
name.  Your character will automaticly put the EQ on in a slot if there is no
other EQ equipped there.  However, you cannot if there that slot is filled and
it will remain in your inventory.  In order to see what you have equipped you
can enter Equipment.  This will bring up a list of all the slots you are
currently using and what is there.  All items are designated to a certain slot.
For example, a Bracelet will usually only be able to be worn on the wrist.  
There are two Wrist slots.  Therefore, you can wear two pieces of EQ that are
made for wrists.  Some EQ have the ability to be worn in many places.  If you
wish to assign this piece to a specific slot, enter Wear (EQ name) (Slot name).
An example: Wear cloth waist.  This will put the Cloth around your waist if
there is nothing already there and it is able to be equipped there.  If you
don't want to wear it anymore, just type Remove and the Item's name while you
have it equipped.  In addition to what you can wear, there are also slots for
Wield and Hold.  The command Wield is for Weapons while Hold is for objects you
cannot wear.  For these, type Wield or Hold (respectively) and then the EQ
name.  If you wish to give an Item to someone, just enter Give, then the Item's
name, then the person's name.  Also, Wear, Drop, Remove, Give and Get can be
combined with All to do that action to all that is in your Inventory or on the
ground at that moment.  If you wish to completely get rid of an object, you can
simply enter Junk to dissolve it, Sacrifice to get a coin for it and dissolve
it, or Donate to send it to the Donation Room found in Phobos.  All of these
commands have to have the Item's name after it and can also be affected by the
All addition.

   This is the Room Help Book.  There are six directions: north, south, east,
west, up, and down.  You can either type the whole thing or just the first
letter of the word.  For example instead of entering north, you can enter n.  
Both will make you go north.  Doors can be opened with the command open door
and then the direction.  The command close door and then the direction will
close it.  You can also unlock and lock the doors using a similar command:
Unlock (or lock) door then the direction.  This next section will tell you
about the different types of environments rooms can have and how to deal with
each of them.  In rooms where there is water and you don't have a boat, you
will get this message: You need a boat to go there.  All you need is a boat in
your inventory and you can go in any water.  You can also cast a spell called
water breathing on yourself to swim in noswim water.  In rooms where you must
fly, and you don't have the spell on, you will get this message: You must be
able to fly to enter!  There is a spell called 'float' and you need it to go to
these areas.  If your 'float' spell runs out, you will fall to your death and
die a miserable one at that!  There are also dark rooms.  You will notice it
says "Someone says," when anyone talks.  That means you can't tell who it is.
Here, you need a form of light such as a lantern to see.  You will also notice
you can't see anything in your inventory...  This can be a big disadvantage if
your in a dark room with no light.

book guilds~
   This is the Guild Help Book There are four guilds in this realm.  They all
have different skills, attributes, and abilities.  They are: Mage, Cleric,
Thief, and Warrior.  Mages are magical casters, their hit points are low but
their mana is high.  They excel in attack magic and harmful spells.  Mages are
slightly hard to manage, clearly the choice for a player who has suffered the
rigors of MUDs before.  Clerics are also magic casters, but their hitpoints are
a little higher than Mages and their mana is a little less.  They are adept at
healing spells and great for parties.  Clerics can heal themselves in battle
and also have the powerful spell of Sanctuary, which grants them double
protection against damage.  Thieves are the dark class; they have ability to
use many hiding and secretive skills.  Their hit points are much higher than
the magic classes but they do not gain mana.  Thieves have skills such as
Backstab and Sneak and generaly have to use other tactics in battle than just
head on fighting.  Warriors are the pure fighting force guild.  They excel in
fighting and their hit points are the highest of any guild.  Warriors do not
gain mana, either, but they have fighting skills.  Usually a warrior just runs
in to a battle headlong with out thinking, and has the courage to rescue their
friends.  After a Player reaches the level of 30, they get a special privilege.
It is called Multiclassing.  The Guildmasters of Phobos allow you to level in
ONE extra guild so you can gain only SOME of that guild's skills.  When you
gain skills or spells in other guilds, they are not as strong as if that were
your original guild.  This can also be done again at level 45 and then again at
level 60 Another thing you should know about is Stat Buying.  Once you reach
level 60 in your first guild, you may buy stats such as hit points and mana.  
By paying a large sum of money to Stan the Stat Shack Man, you can boost your
hit points, mana and movement above their normal level.  Each class has a
different amount of stats they can buy up to before they have to stop.  
Another thing you might want to be aware of is the Secret Guild that you can
join once you reach the level of 25...  Hidden somewhere in the city of Phobos
is a secret guild where it is possible to become a member of...  This guild is
secretive and gives certain special abilities to its members.  This MUD
features In Guild Leveling.  This means, in order to level you must go to your
guild and type Gain Level.  You must also have the correct amount of
experience, and if you are multiclassing, the correct amount of gold.  A map of
Phobos is contained at CA or the Center Agora (the center of Phobos, go up),
This map shows the way to each of the guilds.  Another thing that must be done
at guilds is the practicing of skills and spells.  You don't automatically gain
skills and spells, you must pick and choose which skills that would best suit
you.  You must enter Practice at your guild to see which skills you have left
unpracticed.  You can also practice Weapon Proficencies.  These are how well
you can handle certain types of weapons.  If you have "Daggers" praticed
completely, and the weapon you are using is a Dagger, you will do more damage.
Another important thing to know is the Level command, when you type Level it
will display how much exp you need for each class.

   This is the Combat Help Book.  First of all, you have statistics, or stats.
To find out what your stats are, type score sheet, or just sc.  This will bring
up a large sheet concerning yourself.  The first part gives you your name,
class, level of your primary class, and your age.  The second part will give
you your HP (how much damage you can take until you die), Mana (your "energy"
to cast spells), and Movement (restricts how far you can walk).  It then
displays your Exp (Experience Points), which you need to level up.  Kill
monsters to get this, then level at your guild.  Next you have your Armor (the
less you have, the less chance the enemy can hit you; goes from -100 to 100),
then Alignment (1000=pure good, -1000=pure evil, 0=neutral), then your total
play time, it also displays how much gold you have.  Next you have your Damroll
(the more you have, the harder you hit), and your Hitroll (The more you have,
the more chance for you to hit the enemy).  Next is something important to
watch, you have STR (Strength, which makes you hit harder and makes you able to
carry more weight), Wis (Wisdom, how many practices you will get when you
level), Int (Intelligence, how much mana you will get when you level) There is
also Dex (Dexterity, how much movement you get when you level), Con
(Constitution, how much HP you will get when you level), and finally Cha
(Charisma, lowers prices on products you buy).  The last three lines give you
info on your inventory, stance, and affects (Spells on you at the moment.  
NOTE: not there if there are no spells on you).  Before you rush into a battle,
you might want to see how tough the opponent is in comparison to you.  Type
concider or just con and the mobs name to size yourself up to the mob.  You
might get something like, 'The perfect match!  '.  This means you're about
equal.  Beware though, sometimes they can look weaker than they actually are!

book basics~
   This is the Basics Help Book.  First we will go over the Autos.  These
commands will give you more information and help in battle.  First, you'll
probably want AutoExit.  This command automatically displays the exits of the
room when the description is shown.  Very handy for finding your way around the
MUD.  Look which allows you to actually look at the room and see the people,
objects, mobs, title of the room, and the description of the room.  When you
look, you can see the room exits at the bottom of the total room description.
It should look something like this: [Exits: u ].  This indicates that there is
an exit going up.  The next couple of Autos we will be dealing with are for
battle, so just keep them in mind for further use.  If you plan to go battling
enemies along with friends, you will want to help them as they battle, right?
This is where Autoassist comes in.  Autoassist will automatically help out your
buddies if they start battling.  But they will not help you if you start the
battle.  Only if they have Autoassist on will they then help you.  There are no
visible changes when you activate this Auto.  Just enter Autoassist and it will
activate.  After a battle there will be many spoils for the taking.  To save
you the trouble of typing "get all corpse", there is an option called Autoloot.
Autoloot automatically loots the corpse for any and all items or equipment it
may be carrying.  Along with items, there is also gold you can acquire from
corpses.  To automatically get the gold after a kill, activate Autogold.  
Autoloot is the same as Autogold: it will also take gold from the corpse.  
However, if you wish to only recieve gold, turn off Autoloot and turn on
Autogold.  If you're in a group, though, your friends may want some money, too.
In this case, activate Autosplit, which will automatically split the gold
evenly throughout your group.  Again, all these autos will not have a visible
change.  By now you have noticed a bar at the bottom after every command.  
There are some numbers and some letters in brackets <> or just a simple >.  
This is your Prompt bar.  This little wonder will display your hit points, mana
points, and movement points (all of which are essential to Mudding).  There are
three main ways to see the Prompt bar: There is Prompt none, which will only
leave a >.  There is Prompt all, which displays hit, mana, and move points
(abbreviated with H/M/V).  Then there is the specific Prompt.  Using Prompt
[H/M/V] or any combination of the three.  For example, if you put in Prompt HV,
then it will display your hit and movement points.  Also Prompt H = displays
hit points only.  If you have a program that displays color, you're in luck,
this next section is on color.  If not, take a breather and be jealous of those
who do.  The Color command will change the amount of color you see as you go
along in the MUD.  There are four levels.  There is Color off, which will turn
it off, Sparse, which will only display a few, Normal, which will be a little
more, and Complete which will dazzle your eyes with color.  Finally, there is
the Social list which will show the different Emotes you can do.  Just enter
Social and it will pop up.  Then enter any of the words from the list to get a
funny action to be preformed.  You should try it.  You can also Emote things
that aren't on the social list.  Commands like 'Emote does a little dance.  '
will display to your friends: [so-and-so] does a little dance.

It is a very heavy scythe.  The grey handle is made from hard wood and the
long iron blade is completely smooth from countless years of use.  It feels
cold to the touch.
