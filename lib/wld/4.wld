Near the Shore~
   A giant ocean expands to the south.  It is extremely massive and looks very
dangerous to cross.  Not to mention the mist that makes it a virtual maze to
those who don't know their way around it very well.  But who knows what riches
may lie on the unexplored coast.  The beach is sandy white and looks like a
nice place to take a nap.
