pilot's hat~
The pilot's hat is quite large compaired to the average pilot's hat.  It's
covered in black fabric and its visor is black as well.  The visor also looks
rater sharp and could be used as a half-decent weapon.

Arkadia's Katana~
This katana is long and straight.  The blade is unbelievably sharp and the
sword itself is very light.  The hilt consists of a strange black cloth that
doesn't seem to be of this world, but it is very comfortable and provides a
firm grip to the sword.
