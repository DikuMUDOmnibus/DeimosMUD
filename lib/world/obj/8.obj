   Along with religion, rank is another thing that the Controller cannot
change.  The Cestarians are ranked by their phisical power and their AK
(Available Knowledge).  It's good to have a balance between the two but
sometimes when one area is very high, it doesn't really matter about the other.
Long ago, the Cestarians agreed to make it as easy as possible to know what
rank one is.  From this, they came up with the idea to paint each other colors
that would correspond with their rank; the lowest being the coolest of the
colors, and the highest being the hottest of the colors.  In this case,
&DGrey&n to &RRed&n.  They also used this to make "keys".  You see, the doors
in Cesta use hand-color recognition, therefore, one must have one's hand the
required color of the security level.  The lowest class is th color &DGrey&n,
they have no access whatsoever to anything but their home.  &mPurple&n class is
usually the worker class, seen in Cold Fusion Power Plants around Cesta, they
have access to low level rooms such as their boss's room.  &bBlue&n class,
known as directors, watches over the &mPurples&n and have access to Level 1
security rooms such as the doors to the Inner Square.  &GGreen&n class
Cestarians are the technicians and help develop the rockets and ground rovers,
they have the key to Level 2 security rooms such as a &YYellow&n class room.  
&YYellow&n class is the second to the top of the ranking chart, and is usually
found working for the Controller or owning major companies.  &RR&red&n class
Cestarians are the truely gifted class.  Although none come to the &RBright
Red&n color of the Controller, the &rBlood Red&n colors of one usually means
that that Cestarian is either SUPER strong, or SUPER smart.  The Controller is
usually both of these.  Every 3 years, each Cestarian is to report to the
re-colorizing facility where they will be colored either their original one, a
demoted one, an upgraded one, or to have them to be interdicted in which they
are stripped of their color.  Cestarians &ywithout color&n are shunned and
often killed by other disgusted Cestarians by stoning.

   The laws of Cesta are very similar to an advanced democracy; The people get
to vote on who gets to rule over them.  The difference is is that the votes go
directly to the tallying, unlike in a normal democracy where the votes of the
people are only there to shift the oppinions of a large group of people who
then vote.  When one is voted to become the ruler of Cesta, he is given the
title "Almighty Cardinal" or just Cardinal.  The Cardinal can change basically
anything about the laws making him all powerful.  The only thing he cannot
change is the religion.  The religion of Cesta is based upon three gods,
Kloired, the god of flesh and blood, Fraak, the god of ground and water, and
finally, Badsuik, the god of space (as in outerspace).  The Cestarians are very
critical about their gods and worship them heartily.  These religions can only
be changed by the high priests that reside deep within the moon's core.  One
must travel through it to reach them and ask them to change the religion.

   There is little we know about the Cestarian's history except for that before
they learned to utilize the power of machines and energy, they were excellent
hunters.  Their sharp claws and teeth were the perfect tool for cutting and
ripping apart prey.  Although, when they started to construct buildings, they
quickly melded into the tech-age with huge skyscrapers, computers, and cold
fusion power plants.  But although they developed all this, they still retained
their love for battle and thus, in every city you will see a battle ground
where the Cestarians come to fight eachother in glorious combat.  As of now,
they have a totalitarian government where one ruler (called the controller)
makes all laws and religion and so forth.

   The anatomy of a Cestarian is much unlike a human's.  It is bipedal with two
arms, eyes, and ears.  It also has tiny slits for a nose and another one for
it's mouth.  What differs from a human's anatomy and a Cestarian's anatomy is
muscle tone, bone strength, and height.  The average Cestarian is about double
the strength of a level 10 human.  It is also able to lift three times its
weight because of its stong bone structure.  The bones of a Cestarian are
completely solid, save for a small internal structure of triangles.  Of course,
knowing that the triangle is the strongest type of support, a Cestarian femur
can withstand four times the pressure of a human femur.  The average Cestarian
is about 10-15 feet tall, good for tackling smaller prey and clawing them to
death.  The size of a single claw can measure up to four inches long, a tooth,
two inches, and a foot claw, five inches.  Finally, because of their barbaric
habits of hunting and senseless battling the species has developed a higher
sense of smell, sight, and hearing.  The Cestarian is always on guard, hunched
over and claws outstreched.  The muscles bulge out of the skin because of their
massiveness.  These creatures are to be approached with &REXTREME&n caution!
