   The great fountain of North Zyria is an amazingly tall fountain built
centuries upon The great fountain of North Zyria is an amazingly tall fountain
built centuries ago when the Zyrian Empire was only a small city.  It was later
moved to the Empires Northern District for the Empire's enfamous Hall of
Guilds.  The fountain's black stone is almost indistructable.  No other
material can be found like it as if the fountain's substance was not of this
world.  Tons of water stray into their air from the twenty dark red jets.  On
top lies a statue of the first leader of the Zyrian Empire, King Zyrik.
