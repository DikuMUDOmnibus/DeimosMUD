boo box~
   It is shaped like the clichd treasure box, only its black, and big...  Big
enough to fit a person in.  It also has a slot in it...  Interseting.

fencing sword~
   The fencing sword is long and slender with a point as sharp as a needle.  
Because of its light weight you can really fling it around to do some damage.
But you are able to use it as something like a dagger.  The sword shines with a
mithril glow!

   The Chef's hat is a big cylinder with a poofy top on it.  Made for keeping
in the hair to keep out of the food.  It looks very heavy, yet very protective.
