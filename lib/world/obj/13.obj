glow card betting~
   It is said to hold powers of luck and skill to whoever holds it.  The bet
written on the card is cryptic and unable to decipher.  It looks close to some
type of rune language though.

   The Official Better's Hat is unlike any other.  Made of a soft, yet sturdy,
velvet-like metal, it is the peak of being a better.  A person who has this is
likely to get a LOT of recognition.  It is dark brown and has a white stripe
around the rim.

   The little plush doll is actually quite alive!  If you use it as a weapon,
it will grab onto your hand with its sharp claws!  However, the spikes on its
back will spring up, ready for you to attack with.  It is very deadly, but will
give you some handicaps.

  There is a room where past screams abound.  Where forsaken lies as pure as
the ground, are forced from the bodies where truth is not found.  In a large
tomb of stone so stern, does a small jack-o-lantern burn.  

There is a second passage...  

Where gasses combine and make molecules, there is a place that
contains some rules.  If one was to break it, or maybe just fake it, he would
live here till he cools.
