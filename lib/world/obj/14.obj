It.
Poor you, have fun getting rid of it. It is a family fun torture tool. Widely used in ancient times, this item is dreaded!
If you have it, well, you must be an idiot. 
Unfortunately, it does not like having its feelings hurt, so you can't get rid of it.

Lyra's 'DeimosMUD for Dummies' book~
Lyra's 'DeimosMUD for Dummies' book~
A book is lying here.~
This is Lyra's personal little help guide for new immortals..or old ones.
Make sure you type read 'chapter1' or 'chapter2' etc.
Chapter1= Being an Idiot
Chapter2= OLC (REDIT)

Chapter2~
   If Lyra said she'd teach you OLC, and she hasn't yet (she's a busy chica!  
),then look at this first.  It may be of some help.  Depending on how much you
know, i'll start from the very beginning.  This is a computer.  You are typing
with a keyboard, a modern-style typewriter..  Ok, hopefully you know that junk
Now that you are (hopefully) immortal here, you will need a zone.  Type 'stat
me' and look for the OLC section, which will have a number by it.  If that
number isn't -1, then you have a zone!  Your zone rooms are your zone number
00-99, meaning if you had zone 99, then your rooms are 9900 to 9999 You won't
be able to edit any other zones while you are set to this zone.  Depending on
who gave you your zone, you may already have empty rooms made for you.  Type
rlist <yourzone's first #> <Your zone's last #> to see how many rooms are
already made for you.  If you have rooms already made, it is easier because you
can map out things first and make rooms later.  If you don't have rooms, you
will have to work harder.  The main thing you will be building is rooms.  To do
this, you type redit.  If you are in your zone in a room, then you can redit
the room you are standing in.  But if you have no rooms, then you have to type
'redit <room#>' to make it.    
Now, the way to use your redit:
1)Name  : {I think this is pretty self explanatory.. just put in your room title.}
2) Description:  This is what a mortal will see when they walk into the room.. enter a few lines, preferably at least three, and make them let us know what your room is like. :-) To start out editing, you'll need to type /c to clear out what was there.
Then enter a few lines, making sure to hit enter after every sentence or so, so that your lines aren't too long and don't get cut off.  Then when you are done type /fi so your description looks like a paragraph, then @ or /s to save it.
3) Roomflags:  {This is probably one of the most confusing ones to you... Even I don't understand all of the commands, but you don't need to use them all.
Dark= A mortal will need a light to be able to see the description and such in this room.
Death= A deathtrap!  Kills the mortal and they are unable to get their corpse or belongings.
!Mob= No wandering mobs will come in.
Indoors= Doesn't really matter.. just means you aren't outside :-) If there's something special for this then ask an imp, not me.
Peaceful= You won't be able to attack a mob in this room.
Soundproof=  A mortal will not be able to use any of the public or tell channels from this room.
!Track= You cannot be tracked in this room.
!Magic= Prevents a mortal from using magic or spells.  Be careful as this will prevent them from using recall spells or scrolls!
Tunnel:  I think this pretty much only lets one person in.
Private:  Not sure..I think it only lets two people in a room then gives you a message saying a private conversation is in progress.
Godroom= Only Implementors can go in on their own...don't make these!
Good_regen= A mortal character going there will heal faster..limit your use of this.
I know i've left out a few commands, but it's ok!
4) Sector : {You really don't need to worry about this.}
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a) {exits!}
We now have the dig command, which will link a room to another and make the exit back for you.. to use it type 'dig <direction> #'  Please try not to make typos into other people's zones!!
When you are making an exit, just enter in the number.. if you have a door, you will have to give it a keyword and set it as a door also.  
To have it a locked door, there are TWO steps.  First make a key with oedit and enter it's number into the right spot (#4).  THEN you will have to zedit set the door as locked, but i'll explain it more later.
To purge an exit, just type 6.
B) Extra descriptions:
This is how you can make a sign on the wall and such.  They are very easy usually.
Just type in what you want for the description and save it! That easy!
When you are done, quit, save, and then type redit save.

Chapter1~
   Believe it or not, it happens everywhere, even here.  You are most likely an
immortal now, so please be serious.  First of all, if you have come to be a
builder, then actually building.  Talking to others and having fun is allowed
too, but we don't have a lot of time to waste, so work a lot.  Also, if you
aren't serious about building here, you might as well self-delete now.  We
don't need builders that never stop in..  If you are gonna be gone or
something, just let us know and it'll all be good.  If you don't know OLC, then
you'll need to be taught.  You can either look in this book or ask a builder or
implementor.  The head builders are Nightmare and Lyra, we can help you with
your questions and teach you OLC, that is why we are here.  It's best if you
have another messenger program if you need help too.  While you're in OLC you
can't talk, and it's kinda hard to get help.  Someone may snoop you to help
you, but that's about the only reason you will be watched.  Still, be on your
best behavior.  That brings me to my next point, DON'T ABUSE THE COMMANDS!  We
keep losing the cool ones due to misuse.  Yeh, it's probably ok to try out your
commands a few times to see what they are good for, but repetitiveness is not
tolerated.  To see some of our rules, type policy or handbook.  Just follow the
rules, listen to imps, work hard, and have fun!    
By the way, if you ARE an idiot or dumbass, we'll ban you and make a room just to mock you. :-P
Also, Confucius gets pissed off really fast, so don't mess with the powerful god!
