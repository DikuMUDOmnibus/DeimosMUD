&M| | &Y   There are for elemental crystals: Fire, Water, Earth &M| |
&M| | &Yand Wind. But these crystals have broken, and their     &M| |
&M| | &Yshards have been scattered across the world. There are  &M| |
&M| | &Ytwelve shards for each of the four crystals, totaling   &M| |
&M| | &Yto fourty-eight crystal shards. If you can find all of  &M| |
&M| | &Ythe shards for one of the crystals, go to the forge and &M| |
&M| | &Yassemble them back into the crystal.                    &M| |
&M| | &Y   The only real prize for attained the shards or the   &M| |
&M| | &Ycrystals is money. Below shows the value of the shards  &M| |
