following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"
  Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

"group all" groups all people who are following you.

each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with

internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2

may be used repeatedly and in any order:

monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: use <staff>

grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?

monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"

#0

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

GSAY

Usage: gsay <string>

defined as follows:  AC  Roughly equivalent to
-----------------------------------------------------------
  100  Naked person (No armour)
    0  Moderatly Armoured (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -100  Completely Armoured

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you must goto your guild to raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you do not get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

FLAGS

Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  FLAG        MEANING
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  (KILLER)    Player is trying to kill other players.  That means you
              can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
  (THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
  (invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are
              sensitive to the presence of invisible things.
  (writing)   Player is writing on the board; do not disturb.
  (mailing)   Player is writing mail; do not disturb.
  (deaf)      Player has chosen not to hear shouts.
  (notell)    Player has chosen not to accept tells.
  (quest)     Player is participating in a quest currently being run by
              the Gods.
  (AFK)       Player is not currently playing the mud and is not accepting
              tells.
  (Meeting)   Player is in a meeting with other players in a room and is 
              not accepting tells.
  (WhoInvis)  This is for ASSASSINS only.  Only other assassins can see you
		  on WHO when this flag on.

HOUSES

A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses. Contact the Holiday Inn for room prices.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

I   If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II  If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

III Cutting your link and then going on as another character is considered
    multi-playing, and is against the rules.

IV  Losing your Link is no excuse to get reimbursed unless it was due a MUD   
    side error as opposed to a user's connection problem.

MANA

Mana is used when casting spells.  You must have a certain amount of mana
in order to cast any particular spell.  If you do not have enough mana to
cast the spell you must rest until you gain enough points to cast.

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

MULTICLASS MULTICLASSING

Multiclassing is the ability to level in all four guilds. Your ability to
level in other guilds than your prime guild is determined by your level
in your prime guild. You can multiclass into differant guilds at these 
levels: 30, 45, 60. Leveling in other guilds than your prime guild requires
gold as well as experience.

|
#0
PRIME

Your prime class is the class that you start in first. It is chosen when you
first create you character.
|
#0
MASTER GRANDMASTER

Once you have reached the level of 60 in a guild, you are said to have Mastered
this guild.

Example: [ { 0 60  0  0} ] Tom Bombadil the Master Warrior

Once you have reached level 60 in all guilds you are said to have achieved the
status of GrandMaster. At this point you will be extremely strong and probably
have attained much respect from the other playeres. Once you become a grandmaster
you can then obtain 50 more levels.  You gains are based on your prime class.  Also
The price in experience and gold is standardized at 200,000,000 xp and 20,000,000
gold per GM level.Example: [GM:    1    :GM] Tom Bombadil the GrandMaster

CLERIC

Clerics are the priest class of Deimos.  They live spiritual lives and focus on protecting 
and healing others through magical means.  They are devoted to whichever God they serve.  
Clerics can also be good or evil, depending on their God.  What is important to classify 
a cleric different from a mage is the magic each uses.  Clerics themselves have very little 
offensive magic and it used as a last resort in thier defense.

Ultimate: Manashield

#0
MAGE

Mages are the wielders of powerful destructive magic.  As they are seekers of changing elements 
and not maintaining order through magic, they do not dabble into the healing arts.  Mages 
spend many years studying the arcane arts of destructive magic and can wreak havoc on their enemies
with their powerful spells of destruction.

#0
FORCE

|
#0

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

#0
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

#0
GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

NO MATTER WHAT YOU MUST SET THE MIN LEVEL TO THE LEVEL OF THE STAT
YOU GIVE YOUR ITEM. All stats do not have to equal the level but the
highest stat must be equal to the min level.

It is OKAY to make useless items not everything in the world has a
