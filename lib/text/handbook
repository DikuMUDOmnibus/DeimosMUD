-========== DeimosMUD Godly Handbook ==========-
Builders
 - No Personal Items/Rooms/Mobs, really you don't need them
Mortals
 - Immortals are allowed to have mortal characters.
 - Immortals may not help their character in anyway.
 - Deities and above may have 2 characters on at once
   1 mortal, 1 Immortal
 - Lower Immortals May only have 1 character on at a time
 - An Immortal's Mortal can not participate in any of that Immortal's
   quests or any quests he helped create.
 - Immortal's Mortals may participate in other Immortal's Quests and quests
   they did not help create.
 - Immortals may NOT load eq for any mortals or TANK (take the damage in a fight)
   for mortals.
 - Immortals MAY imprison Mortals who they suspect are doing illegal things.
 - Immortals May not have a "Test Char" which they help.
 - Immortals can Help Mortals for ONLY these reasons-

             1. Quest involving multiple mortals
             2. General Verbal Orientation/Help
             3. The case that the problem is the Your (Not other Imms).          
             4. Someone else breaches any policy and it effects
                them.
    Immortals cannot Help Mortals for these reasons-
             1. Friend to Mortal
             2. You "owe" them.
            3. It contradicts our policies.
Clans
 - Immortals may sponsor only one clan.
 - Immortals cannot have their mortal be the leader of the clan they sponsor.
 - Immortals' Mortals may be *members* of clans they sponsor. Not leaders!
 - Immortals cannot favor clan members in anyway except by giving them verbal
   council.
Information and Power
   Any information an immortal gets from immortal powers, (Example: Conspire stuff
   without having an assassin mortal on to hear it.), cannot be used to help their
   sponsored clan, and should not be used to help any mortal character they might have.
   Power is not to be taken lightly. We don't admire people that use their powers
   without first consulting themselves. We don't admire power hungry people either.
   Use your powers for good, not for evil.
