* Missed backstab is sometimes shown after kill.
* Ranks are all screwed up

* CRASH: title with notitle on crashes game

Enhancements

* get rid of recall spell; make recall cost 3/4? mv for everybody
* make improved ranks with HTML output
* commaify bank transactions
* make identify show armor wear spots/weapon attack types


Needs Discussion
* it doesn't make sense to lose stats when you die if you can't earn them back any way (besides gold chip)
* make a way to recharge staffs? maybe a merchant can do it for a price, or you can find e.g. an energy stone to do it with
